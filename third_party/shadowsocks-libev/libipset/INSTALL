Installation instructions
=========================

The ipset library is written in ANSI C.  It uses cmake as its build
manager.


Prerequisite libraries
----------------------

To build ipset, you need the following libraries installed on your
system:

  * pkg-config
  * libcork
  * libcork (https://github.com/redjack/libcork)
  * check (http://check.sourceforge.net)


Building from source
--------------------

The ipset library uses cmake as its build manager.  In most cases, you
should be able to build the source code using the following:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PREFIX
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

You might have to run the last command using sudo, if you need
administrative privileges to write to the $PREFIX directory.
